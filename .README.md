# Parker's Dotfiles

## Overview

This repo contains my personal dotfiles, managed via [a bare Git repository](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/).

## Using this repo

First, fork this repo on GitHub.

Clone the repo into a bare repo named `.dotfiles`:

    $ git clone --bare git@github.com:username/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
    
Source `.dotfiles/.zsh/dotfiles.zsh` to get an alias named `dotfiles`. This is a wrapper around `git` that uses that your home directory as the working copy and the bare repository as a the Git directory.

    $ . .dotfiles/.zsh/dotfiles.zsh
    
Checkout the dot files into your home directory.

    $ dotfiles checkout
    
Modify your dot files.
    
    $ $EDITOR .oldapp.conf
    $ dotfiles add .oldapp.conf
    $ dotfiles commit
    $ dotfiles push origin master

The `dotfiles` alias hides untracked files (because all the files in your home directory are now technically untracked files), so new files must be added "blindly".

    $ touch .newapp.conf
    $ $EDITOR .newapp.conf
    $ dotfiles status
     On branch master
     Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
     nothing to commit, working directory clean
    $ dotfiles add .newapp.conf
    $ dotfiles status
     On branch master
     Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
     Changes to be committed:
             new file:   .newapp.conf
             
Alternatively, there's a `dotfiles-all` alias which does show untracked files.

    $ touch .othernewapp.conf
    $ dotfiles-all status
     On branch master
     Changes to be committed:
             new file:   .othernewapp.conf

     Untracked files:
             .Skype/
             .Xauthority
             .cache/
             .config/
             ...
             .othernewapp.conf
             ...
